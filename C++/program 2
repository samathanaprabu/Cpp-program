/* Prob 2: Write a program to check whether a triangle can be formed with the given values for the angles.

If sum of angles is equal to 180, then triangle can be formed, else it can't be formed.

Input: 45 45 45

Expected Output: 

Triangle cannot be formed

Explanation -> We are getting 3 inputs, that is three angles of triangle, but here the sum of three angles that is 45+45+45 is not equal to 180 so Triangle cannot be formed is the output. */

/* Logical :
Sum = a+b+c
after if statement check SUM value equal tree value */ 


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b, c;
      cout << "Enter the values of angles a, b, and c: " << endl;
    
    
    cin >> a >> b >> c;

    int sum = a + b + c;

    
    if (sum == 180) {
        cout << "The angles form a valid triangle." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "The angles do not form a valid triangle." << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
